        //but $this->id solve that, since we are in Ingredient model we can do $this->id becuase that model has an automatic $this-id
        //that give you the id of an instance , and this i did not know , so maybe read about it, read more laravel docs, you need more

        /*  this is respoble for increase and decreasing stock by use ORM:
        here is raw sql

        // FROM ingredients
        // INNER JOIN add_to_ingredient

            this pretty much just take the sum of all ingredient quantity  in pivot , 
            then it it either add or decrease

            this is a visualize docs in tablet, i nreallly dont fully understand this yet
