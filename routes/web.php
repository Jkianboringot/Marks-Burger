    // i will be using this so that i can seperate the admin panel and it having full filament suport no issues
    // and i can use web as a route for the cashier side for livewire blade
    //probable will create a role check but that sould be easy because i can make it the be the same as prev system
    //also i only really have 2 role admin and cashier adn manager but that came later

    //i might not even need to check role, i can just have a button that show if they want to login as admin, manager, or cashiers
    //and check it here adn base on it have login for that, its like portal for catsu
